Hello to all who may read.

I am Michael Giurcanu, and I am currently a senior at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. 

Take a look and see some of the things that I have done over the years. 

Projects are labled alongside the year that they were completed. 

I had an internship opportunity, and I also put the code for that in here as well. In the project file is a poster of my project that I presented in a symposium.
